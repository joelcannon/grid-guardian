## Purpose

GridGuardian is a web application to monitor the health of electrical grids using energy harvesting wireless IoT connected sensor devices. It will track key metrics like voltage, tilt, temperature, etc and provide real-time alerts on any issues. The goal is to improve grid reliability and prevent failures.

## Audience

The target users are electrical utility operators who need to maintain grid infrastructure over a large geographical area. The app gives them visibility into remote assets and early warning of problems.
